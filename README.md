# FAKE_TRC20
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract designed to simulate the Tether USD (USDT) TRC20 token, specifically for testing purposes on the Tron Shasta testnet. It's ideal for developers building marketplaces or dApps that need a mock USDT for their Tron testnet environment without dealing with real funds.
